# Heart Disease Prediction Data Analysis

This repository contains Python code for analyzing a dataset related to heart disease prediction. The dataset includes various features that can be used to predict the presence or absence of heart disease in individuals.


The dataset used for analysis is stored in the `heart.csv` file. It contains the following features:

- Age: Age of the individual (in years)
- Sex: Gender of the individual (0 - Female, 1 - Male)
- ChestPainType: Chest pain type (0 - Typical angina, 1 - Atypical angina, 2 - Non-anginal pain, 3 - Asymptomatic)
- RestingBP: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)
- Cholesterol: Serum cholesterol level (in mg/dl)
- FastingBS: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 - True, 0 - False)
- RestingECG: Resting electrocardiographic results (0 - Normal, 1 - Abnormality, 2 - Probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy)
- MaxHR: Maximum heart rate achieved (in beats per minute)
- ExerciseAngina: Exercise induced angina (1 - Yes, 0 - No)
- Oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
- ST_Slope: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (0 - Upsloping, 1 - Flat, 2 - Downsloping)
- HeartDisease: Presence of heart disease (1 - Yes, 0 - No)


It includes the following analyses:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Summary statistics, distribution of features, etc.
2. Gender-based Analysis: Presence of heart disease by gender.
3. Age-based Analysis: Presence of heart disease by age group.
4. Chest Pain Type Analysis: Presence of heart disease by chest pain type.
5. Correlation Analysis: Correlation between different features and the presence of heart disease.

To run the analysis script, you need to have Python installed on your system along with the following libraries:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
